#JWT Authentication Overview

This project implements JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication for secure access to protected APIs. Users must log in to receive a JWT, which is then included in request headers for authorization.

Accepts credentials as JSON (e.g. username and password)

Returns a JWT in the response

Token Usage

Include the JWT in the Authorization header for protected endpoints:

Authorization: Bearer <your_token>

Protected Routes

Requests without valid tokens receive a 401 Unauthorized
